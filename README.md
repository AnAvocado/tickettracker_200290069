My application will allow a small scale IT department to have an app that is a Ticket System, allowing them to address problems in a timely manner. The group owner can add people by adding their email to the "team" list. This will send an ivite to the persons email and allow them to join.
Technologies to be implemented:
Database, Client/Server, User Accounts, automatic-updating.
